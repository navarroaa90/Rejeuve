        <p>I’m Lori Navarro and I have the pleasure and privilege to teach Pilates in the beautiful town of Claremont, California.</p>
        <p>I am a Lover of Movement and believe there are so many ways of expressing it. Pilates is one of the ways I love to move and is what makes my body feel best. What I especially love about Pilates is how it combines elements of gentleness and grace with strength and power.  Dance is another way I love to express myself, Zumba and Booty Barre are both fun ways to exercise. Both forms of exercise build endurance,create long and  lean muscles and challenges our bodies in ways other forms of exercise are unable to do. Coming from a strong medical background, I strive to help both men and women become healthier thru exercise and daily dietary intake, making healthier choices.  I am a firm believer of making exercise fun, not work and the words "I CAN'T", slowly disappears from my clients vocabulary when it comes to challenging workouts!
        </p>
        <p>I was first introduced to Pilates in 2004 and fell in love with the method. Wanting to learn more, I  received my formal education and training through Body Arts and Sciences International under the tutelage of Rael Isacowitz, founder of Body Arts and Science International. </p>
        <p>It is an honor to come alongside each of my clients to help them reach greater health and wellness through Pilates.
       </p>
       <p> I look forward to meeting you!</p><br/>
       <p>Lori Navarro</p><br/>
